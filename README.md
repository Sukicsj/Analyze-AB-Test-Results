# Udacity Dara Analyst Nanodegree - Project 3
# Analyze-AB-Test-Results

# Introduction
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 

The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 

# Goal of the Project
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Findings
- First, I applied hypothesis testing to test whether the new page has a better conversion rate. We are 95% confident that there is no statistical significance to suggest that new page has a better conversion rate. 
- Then, I would like to know what if I add another effect based on the country that a user lives, does this appear to have an impact on the conversion? It turns out that a user who lives in Canada who get a new page would be 1.08 less likely to convert compared to a user in the US. However, the amount is too small and is not practically significance. 

Thus, we do not have much statistical evidence to prove that a new page has a higher conversion rate than an old page. We would suggest not to switch to new page.
